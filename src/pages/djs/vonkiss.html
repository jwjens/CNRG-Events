      <h1>Von Kiss</h1>
      <p>What do you want? Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator. I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her. Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is. I don't know where he is. Nobody knows where he is. What do you mean, nobody knows? Well, uh, you see... Deck Officer. Deck Officer!</p><p>

Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field. Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One...two...three! It's not fair! The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault! No light-speed? It's not my fault. Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for. Turn her around. I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front shield. You're going to attack them?! Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer... Shut up!</p><p>

You have learned much, young one. You'll find I'm full of surprises. Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true. No! All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought. Impressive...most impressive. Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear... now release your anger. Only your hatred can destroy me.</p>
