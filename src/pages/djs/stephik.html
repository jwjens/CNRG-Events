      <p>DJ Stephi K was born in Port Hueneme, CA and grew up in Southern California where she developed a passion and true love for pop, hip hop and rap music. Being inspired by artists like Madonna and 2Pac led her to writing and recording her own style of music. She has worked with several producers as well as being featured on other hip hop artist songs. She began performing live at venues throughout Southern California opening for well known hip hip acts and starred in a her own music video called “Play It Back.” After years of writing, recording, & performing she has embarked on a journey to mix her style of music with hip hop, house, old school, rap, and other forms of music to create her own DJ style.</p>
