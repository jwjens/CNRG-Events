      <h1>Enoc</h1>
      <p>Growing up in California’s Bay Area, “I could just sit by the radio for hours, listening to stations like KMEL and ‘Wild 107’. I grew up listening to guys like Rick Lee of the SBC DJ’s, Dave Meyer, Latin Prince, Mind Motion, Scotty Fox and The Pirate DJ’s,” says E-NOC. “That was my drive to get into radio, I idolized these guys!” But it wasn’t until he moved up to the Sacramento area in the late 90’s, when his dreams became a reality. “While I was at UC Davis, I met up with DJ Tosh from KBMB, who was deejaying at a Sammy fraternity party. He pretty much took me under his wing.” E-NOC started interning at KBMB, which eventually led to a deejay spot on KBMB’s “Bomb Mixshow” where he was nick-named “The Asian Persuasion”.</p>

<p>“I was the only Asian cat who could really get down with these guys.” “But I knew I had made the right career choice when I was able to see Grandmaster Flash live on the tables in San Francisco and chop it up with Jam Master Jay in Puerto Rico at the Mixshow Power Summit. Moments like that are just unforgettable.” After spending 3 years at KBMB, E-NOC parted ways with the station to pursue other avenues. So now, between KDGS, KBOL, being part of the World Famous Bum Squad DJz, mixtapes, syndicating mixes with Mix Matters in Los Angeles and performing at club venues like The Davis Graduate, the Lighthouse, Cafe New Orleans and Vlade Divac’s restaurant “Tune! 21” E-NOC tends to stay pretty busy and his turntables are still very much spinning. “Hip-Hop is a movement, it’s a lifestyle. It’s not a fad, and it’s not going away!” says the Asian Persuasion!</p>
