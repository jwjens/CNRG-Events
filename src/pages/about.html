      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you. No, you don't. You've always been strong. But, why must you confront him? Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. Hey, what's goin' on? Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while. Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's goin' on? I...I can't tell you. Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell? I... Ahhh... I'm sorry. Hold me.</p>
