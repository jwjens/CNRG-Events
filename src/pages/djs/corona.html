      <h1>Corona</h1>
      <p>Meet Johana Dj Corona: one of the most alluring and hottest female Dj’s to hit the music scene. Originally from Denver, she’s now residing in Las Vegas. Dj Corona started testing her talent at weddings and corporate events, but with her passion for music and her drive to make an impact in bigger music markets, she transitioned into the nightlife and club scene. Dj Corona doesn’t settle for one genre of music to integrate into her arsenal: from EDM, Top 40’s, Hip Hop and everything in between, she is unstoppable. Her unique mix of beauty, brains, and style have made her one of the most well- known female Dj’s in the Latin and LGBT community. Dj Corona’s dedication and hunger for growth has landed her in Denver’s biggest club and at the largest Pride parties for the last two years. She has entertained crowds numbering over 365,000 people, and she is still at the beginning of her quest for success! Djing at clubs like Beta Nightclub in Denver (which has been voted #1 dance club by Rolling Stone Magazine 3 years running) and now a resident in major clubs all around the Las Vegas strip, her talent is proven. Joining forces with Definitive Talents means the possibilities are now endless for this hot, rising star!
