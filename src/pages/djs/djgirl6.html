      <h1>Girl6</h1>
      <p><p>In Spike Lee's movie "Girl 6," the lead character (a phone sex operator) used a number instead of her name to remain anonymous. DJ GIRL 6, on the other hand, is far from anonymous, adopting the moniker because the movie reminded her of the harsh realities behind going "all in" to pursue your dreams. Harsh realities aside, DJ GIRL 6 has fought her way to the cutting edge of DJ techniques and technology, blazing trails for others to follow for just over ten years now.</p><p>

      GIRL 6 is a pioneer in the Video DJ movement, not just as a female, but as one of the first commercial video remixers on the scene, period. Her clever and thought-provoking use of wordplay and movie clips won her one of the first video remixer spots on www.crooklynclan.net where she remains the only female to date. She is also the only nationally-known acclaimed female Video DJ. Truly, GIRL 6 has become one of the premiere DJs, VJs, and remixers on the planet, an exclusive club she fought and worked hard to help create.</p><p>

      The driving force behind Miss 6's trailblazing is simple â€“ she's damn good! The simple fact is both her audio and video alike are a manifestation of a lifetime of experience. GIRL 6 has been flirting with DJing her entire life, and it's rather obvious that DJing likes what it sees...</p><p>

      When she was only 15 she worked as a hotel maid to buy her then-boyfriend turntables and a mixer, only to be dumped the day before his birthday. She then spent the next few weeks scratching "f*ck you" into his parents' answering machine. Want to know where that guy ended up? Kinko's in Redding, CA (we looked it up!). Realizing how naturally DJing came to GIRL 6, she became much more aggressive in her pursuit of her dreams. After more than 10 years of perfecting her craft, the manner in which she commands the tools at her fingertips has become nothing short of sorcery. Her magical sets are largely composed of dramatic pauses, comedic elements, movie clips, wordplay, rock, rap and "throwbacks," with uncanny timing that brings nostalgia and energy to even the most fickle of crowds. This time-tested talent has won her a place in the hearts of A-list celebrities who began demanding her as their opening act or touring DJ, including Janet Jackson, the Jonas Brothers, Enrique Iglesias, Joan Jett, Aerosmith, Maroon 5, Sheryl Crow, Boy George,Wyclef and Sir Mix-A-Lot (to name a few). Word spread quickly as she has been in rotation at some of the Nation's hottest clubs and featured in international publications for over eight years as seen below: </p><p>
